# Personalized Advertising Algorithm Implementation - PRD

## Project Overview
Transform the current mock-based advertising system into a sophisticated, ML-driven personalized advertising platform that delivers unique, targeted advertisements to each user based on their actual behavior, preferences, and interaction patterns.

## Current State Analysis
- Mock user preferences (same for all users)
- Static ad content based only on position
- No real personalization logic
- User behavior tracking exists but not utilized for ad targeting

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Real User Preference Integration**: Replace mock preferences with actual database queries
2. **Dynamic Ad Content Generation**: Create personalized ads based on user behavior
3. **Behavior-Based Targeting**: Implement algorithms that learn from user interactions
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure sub-200ms ad delivery times
5. **A/B Testing Framework**: Enable testing of different personalization strategies

### Technical Requirements

#### Database Layer
- Create user preference tracking tables
- Implement ad performance analytics
- Add user behavior scoring system
- Create ad campaign management tables

#### API Layer
- Replace mock preferences with real database queries
- Implement ML-based targeting algorithms
- Add real-time preference updates
- Create ad performance tracking endpoints

#### Frontend Layer
- Dynamic ad content rendering
- Real-time preference updates
- User feedback collection
- Ad interaction tracking

#### Algorithm Requirements
- Collaborative filtering for similar users
- Content-based filtering for product preferences
- Time-decay algorithms for recent behavior
- Category affinity scoring
- Purchase intent prediction

## Success Metrics
- Unique ad content per user (target: 95%+)
- Ad click-through rate improvement (target: 3x current)
- User engagement increase (target: 40%+)
- Ad delivery performance (target: <200ms)
- Personalization accuracy (target: 85%+)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database & Infrastructure

- Implement basic ML targeting
- Add dynamic ad content generation
- Create user preference learning system

### Phase 3: Advanced Algorithms
- Collaborative filtering implementation
- Content-based recommendation engine
- Time-decay behavior analysis
- Purchase intent prediction

### Phase 4: Optimization & Testing
- A/B testing framework
- Performance optimization
- Real-time analytics dashboard
- Continuous learning system

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Node.js, Next.js, Prisma ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ML: Basic algorithms (collaborative filtering, content-based)
- Analytics: Real-time tracking and scoring
- Testing: A/B testing framework

## Risk Mitigation
- Gradual rollout to prevent performance issues
- Fallback to current system if new algorithms fail
- Comprehensive testing before production deployment
- Performance monitoring and alerting

## Future Enhancements
- Advanced ML models (neural networks)
- Real-time bidding integration
- Cross-platform user tracking
- Predictive analytics dashboard
- Automated campaign optimization
