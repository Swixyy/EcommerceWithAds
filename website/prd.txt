Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Project Title:
E-Shop for Technology Products with User Database and Personalized Advertisements

Overview:
The project is a basic e-commerce web application that allows users to browse and purchase technology-related products. It will include user authentication, a database to store user and product information, and a simple system for personalized advertisements. The goal is to demonstrate core functionality, not to build a production-ready system.

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Next.js (React framework)
- Backend: Next.js API routes
- Database: PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM)
- Styling: TailwindCSS
- Authentication: NextAuth.js (or similar)
- Hosting: Localhost or Vercel (for demonstration)

Key Features:
1. User Management
   - Sign up / Login / Logout
   - Profile page displaying user information
   - Store user preferences in database

2. Product Catalog
   - View list of technology products
   - Product detail pages
   - Basic categories (e.g., laptops, smartphones, accessories)

3. Shopping Cart (basic)
   - Add to cart
   - View cart
   - Remove from cart
   - (No real payment integration, just a placeholder checkout)

4. Personalized Advertisements
   - Display ads on homepage or product pages
   - Ads are selected based on user preferences stored in the database
   - Example: if a user viewed many laptop products, show laptop-related ads

5. Admin Panel (optional, basic)
   - Add / edit / delete products
   - Manage users
   - Upload advertisements

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Keep the application simple, focusing on functionality over production readiness
- Database schema managed with Prisma migrations
- Minimal design, just enough for usability
- Basic error handling, no advanced logging or monitoring required

Stretch Goals (if time allows):
- Implement product search and filters
- Add order history for users
- Recommendation system (basic rule-based)

Deliverables:
- Next.js project repository with Prisma integration
- Database schema (Prisma schema file)
- Basic seed data for products and ads
- Documentation on how to run the app locally
